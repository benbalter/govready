  <title xml:lang="en-US">Guide to the Secure Configuration of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6</title>
  <description xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">This guide presents a catalog of security-relevant
configuration settings for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 formatted in the
eXtensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF).  
<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/>
<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/>
Providing system administrators with such guidance informs them how to securely
configure systems under their control in a variety of network roles.  Policy
makers and baseline creators can use this catalog of settings, with its
associated references to higher-level security control catalogs, in order to
assist them in security baseline creation.  This guide is a <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">catalog, not a
checklist,</i> and satisfaction of every item is not likely to be possible or
sensible in many operational scenarios.  However, the XCCDF format enables
granular selection and adjustment of settings, and their association with OVAL
and OCIL content provides an automated checking capability.  Transformations of
this document, and its associated automated checking content, are capable of
providing baselines that meet a diverse set of policy objectives.  Some example
XCCDF <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Profiles</i>, which are selections of items that form checklists and
can be used as baselines, are available with this guide.  They can be
processed, in an automated fashion, with tools that support the Security
Content Automation Protocol (SCAP).  The DISA STIG for RHEL 6 is one example of
a baseline created from this guidance.

    <description xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><!-- purpose and scope of guidance -->
The purpose of this guidance is to provide security configuration
recommendations and baselines for the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 operating
system. The guidance provided here should be applicable to all variants
(Desktop, Server, Advanced Platform) of the product. Recommended
settings for the basic operating system are provided, as well as for many
network services that the system can provide to other systems.
<!-- audience -->The guide is intended for system administrators. Readers are assumed to
possess basic system administration skills for Unix-like systems, as well
as some familiarity with Red Hat's documentation and administration
conventions. Some instructions within this guide are complex.
All directions should be followed completely and with understanding of
their effects in order to avoid serious adverse effects on the system
and its security.

        <description xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">
Data transmitted over a network, whether wired or wireless, is susceptible
to passive monitoring. Whenever practical solutions for encrypting
such data exist, they should be applied. Even if data is expected to
be transmitted only over a local network, it should still be encrypted.
Encrypting authentication data, such as passwords, is particularly
important. Networks of RHEL 6 machines can and should be configured
so that no unencrypted authentication data is ever transmitted between
machines.

        <description xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">
The simplest way to avoid vulnerabilities in software is to avoid
installing that software. On RHEL, the RPM Package Manager (originally
Red Hat Package Manager, abbreviated RPM) allows for careful management of
the set of software packages installed on a system. Installed software
contributes to system vulnerability in several ways. Packages that
include setuid programs may provide local attackers a potential path to
privilege escalation. Packages that include network services may give
this opportunity to network-based attackers. Packages that include
programs which are predictably executed by local users (e.g. after
graphical login) may provide opportunities for trojan horses or other
attack code to be run undetected. The number of software packages
installed on a system can almost always be significantly pruned to include
only the software for which there is an environmental or operational need.

        <description xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">
Whenever possible, a server should be dedicated to serving exactly one
network service. This limits the number of other services that can
be compromised in the event that an attacker is able to successfully
exploit a software flaw in one network service.

        <description xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">
Several tools exist which can be effectively used to improve a system's
resistance to and detection of unknown attacks. These tools can improve
robustness against attack at the cost of relatively little configuration
effort. In particular, this guide recommends and discusses the use of
Iptables for host-based firewalling, SELinux for protection against
vulnerable services, and a logging and auditing infrastructure for
detection of problems.

        <title xml:lang="en-US">Least Privilege</title>
        <description xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">
Grant the least privilege necessary for user accounts and software to perform tasks.
For example, <xhtml:code>sudo</xhtml:code> can be implemented to limit authorization to super user
accounts on the system only to designated personnel. Another example is to limit
logins on server systems to only those administrators who need to log into them in
order to perform administration tasks. Using SELinux also follows the principle of
least privilege: SELinux policy can confine software to perform only actions on the
system that are specifically allowed. This can be far more restrictive than the
actions permissible by the traditional Unix permissions model.

A system reboot is implicitly required after some actions in order to
complete the reconfiguration of the system. In many cases, the changes
will not take effect until a reboot is performed. In order to ensure
that changes are applied properly and to test functionality, always
reboot the system after applying a set of recommendations from this guide.

Hashes</title>
          <description xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en-US">
By default, password hashes for local accounts are stored
in the second field (colon-separated) in
<xhtml:code>/etc/shadow</xhtml:code>. This file should be readable only by
processes running with root credentials, preventing users from
casually accessing others' password hashes and attempting
to crack them.
However, it remains possible to misconfigure the system
and store password hashes
in world-readable files such as <xhtml:code>/etc/passwd</xhtml:code>, or
to even store passwords themselves in plaintext on the system.
Using system-provided tools for password change/creation
should allow administrators to avoid such misconfiguration.
